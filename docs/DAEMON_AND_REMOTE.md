## 1. Two core engines

The launcher can drive the core in two ways. Nothing above the seam sees which one
is active: the UI, tray, keyboard shortcuts and Debug API reach the core only
through the active engine (`CoreBackend`).

| | **Classic** | **Daemon (lxd)** |
|---|---|---|
| Platforms | Windows, macOS, Linux | **macOS only** (Windows x64/arm64 — SPEC 141, with core v1.14.2-lx.2) |
| Default | yes | no, opt-in |
| How the core lives | child process `sing-box run` | inside the long-lived system service `sing-box lxd` |
| Control plane | Clash HTTP API | gRPC (`daemon.StartedService`) + admin REST |
| Applying a config | kill + restart the process | the core is swapped in place, without restarting the service |
| Privileges | macOS: a password on the first TUN start of a launcher session; root runs only the root-owned copy of the core (§2.2) | once, at install time; nothing afterwards |
| Quitting the launcher | brings the VPN down | **leaves the VPN running** by default |
| Core requirement | an ordinary fork build | a build with the `lxd` subcommand (`with_lx_command`) |

Implementation: `LegacyBackend` — the classic spawn; `DaemonBackend` — lxd. Proxy
group operations are abstracted behind the `ProxyTransport` seam (Clash HTTP for
classic, gRPC for daemon), so the server list is identical in both modes.

Build tags (SPEC 141). The engine code — `DaemonBackend` with its DNS, traffic
and tailscale streams, the chain probe, the service classifier and its version
gate, the classic privileged-start gate verdicts, pairing, config preparation,
command assembly, the Debug API wiring — is shared by the *daemon platforms*:
`//go:build darwin || (windows && !386)`. Per-OS parts live next to it:
`*_darwin.go` — launchd, plist, the uid ownership chain (`Stat_t`), the hash
cache key by dev/inode, sudo rendering, Terminal, dialog texts; `*_windows.go` —
extension-point stubs until the Windows service layer lands, and until then the
engine stays closed there (`daemonEngineAvailable`) and the launcher remains on
classic. Linux and Win7 (`windows/386`, Go 1.20, `go.win7.mod`) compile the
stubs tagged `!darwin && (!windows || 386)`; `tools/win7guard` never sees the
daemon files. The gRPC client (`internal/lxdclient`, `internal/daemonpb`) and the
remote-machine code (`core/services/lxd_remote_*.go`) carry no tags and build
everywhere.

### 1.1 Where to switch it

**Local → ⚙ (connection settings) → LOCAL tab** — a Process / Daemon radio.
The radio expresses *intent*: choosing Daemon shows the command panel even before
pairing, and the engine actually switches once pairing is complete (the section's
status line reflects this). The engine can only be switched while the VPN is
stopped.

The **REMOTE** tab of the same window is the older remote Clash API override
(SPEC 064) — a separate thing from daemon mode.

### 1.2 Who owns the core (SPEC 150)

The two engines differ in **who owns the core process**, and that is the whole of
the lifecycle story. It is not merely an implementation detail — it decides what
happens when you close the launcher, and the UI says so explicitly on the LOCAL
tab.

| | **Classic** | **Daemon (lxd)** |
|---|---|---|
| Owner | the launcher process | the system service (`launchd` on macOS) |
| Core lifetime | tied to the GUI | independent of the GUI |
| Quit launcher | core is stopped, the caller waits for it to die | core keeps running (default) |
| UI hint | "The VPN stops when the launcher exits." | "Keep VPN running after quitting the launcher" (on) + "The VPN core runs independently in the system daemon and remains connected when the launcher is closed. Use Stop VPN to disconnect." |

Two separate actions, deliberately:

* **Stop VPN** — asks the owner to bring the core down. In daemon mode this is
  `POST /admin/stop`; the tunnel really goes away.
* **Quit Launcher** — exits the GUI only. It stops the core *only* when the user
  has turned the keep-running option off.

The capability is exposed to the UI through `AppController.CorePersistsAfterAppExit()`,
which type-asserts the active backend onto the optional `persistentCoreBackend`
interface. `LegacyBackend` answers `false` unconditionally (the core is its child;
detaching it would manufacture exactly the orphan the project forbids);
`DaemonBackend` answers `!DaemonStopVPNOnExit`.

**Setting, not migration.** The checkbox reads positively ("Keep VPN running after
quitting the launcher", default **on**), but the stored field is unchanged:
`daemon_stop_vpn_on_exit` in `bin/settings.json`. On is `false`, off is `true`.
The inversion lives in exactly one place in the UI and is pinned by a test.

**Relaunch attaches, never restarts.** When the GUI starts with `-start` while the
daemon already serves traffic, the launcher must *attach*: subscribe to the status
stream, restore the server list, logs and traffic, and leave the running core
alone. `EnsureVPNRunning()` therefore probes the daemon
(`CoreRunningOnDaemon()` → `/admin/status`) instead of trusting the local
`RunningState`, which is still `false` for the first moments after startup. An
unreachable daemon reports `known = false` and does **not** veto auto-start — a
dead socket must not be read as "the VPN is off". A `STARTING`/`STOPPING` frame
also counts as "core present", so an in-process config reload never looks like a
crash and never triggers a redundant `apply`.

**Orphan detection stays classic-only.** The darwin orphan detector matches
`sing-box run|sing-box-lxd run|start-singbox-privileged` — i.e. only processes
that *run* a config. `sing-box lxd --state-dir …` and
`sing-box lxd --service=install` are not matched, so the daemon is never mistaken
for an orphaned child and never killed by GUI-exit housekeeping.

**Watchdog wording is ownership-aware.** The forced-exit watchdog
(`shutdownTeardownDeadline`, `shutdownUnwindDeadline`) logs a *warning* about a
possibly orphaned core in classic mode, and a plain INFO line in daemon
keep-running mode, where a core outliving the GUI is the configured behaviour
rather than a fault.

## 2. Installing the service: sudo, in your own terminal

The launcher **never performs privileged operations itself**. It prepares a ready
sudo command and lets you copy it or open it in Terminal; you see the full output,
and sudo asks you.

| Operation | Command |
|---|---|
| Install or update the service | `sudo <launcher-core> lxd --service=install` |
| Uninstall the service | `sudo <service-core> lxd --service=uninstall --keep-copy` |
| Uninstall along with the daemon's data | the same `+ --purge` |
| Uninstall in **Remove all data…** | `sudo <service-core> lxd --service=uninstall --purge` |
| Mint a fresh invite | `sudo <service-core> lxd client add --name singbox-launcher` |

`<launcher-core>` is the core the launcher uses (Settings → Storage → Core).
`<service-core>` is the service's root-owned copy (§2.1) when the service runs one,
otherwise the launcher core. `--keep-copy` (core lx.12+) removes the plist and the
launchd job but leaves the copy and its `.install.json` in place — the classic TUN start
runs that copy (§2.2). **Remove all data…** offers the full uninstall without it, so
the copy goes away together with the data.

`--service=install` takes no parameters: it picks a free loopback port itself
(19091+, or keeps the address of an existing installation), generates the secret,
forces mTLS on, and prints a **one-time invite** at the end.

After that, starting/stopping the VPN and applying configs need no password.

### 2.1 The service runs a root-owned copy of the core (SPEC 136)

launchd starts the service as root. Earlier cores wrote into
`/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.leadaxe.sing-box-lxd.plist` the path of whatever binary
ran the install command — the core inside the app bundle or in the data folder.
Both files belong to your user account, so any program running as you could replace
the file and get root on the next service start.

Since core **lx.12** the install command copies the core into a root-owned
place and points the plist at the copy:

| What | Where |
|---|---|
| Copy of the core | the flat file `/Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/sing-box-lxd` (`root:wheel 0755`, core lx.12+); no service folder; the root process is named `sing-box-lxd` |
| Install record | `/Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/sing-box-lxd.install.json` (`root:wheel 0644`): source, sha256, version, time, plist, label |

The same command covers every case — first install, an old plist that points at your
own files, and a core update: `sudo <launcher-core> lxd --service=install`. It is
idempotent (an identical core leaves the copy alone), keeps `daemon.json`, the secret
and the paired clients, and restarts the service. After downloading a new core the
launcher shows this command instead of a plain restart: restarting would bring the
old copy back up.

The launcher checks the service without sudo and shows the result on the Status tab
of the LOCAL connection settings:

| State | Meaning | Shown as |
|---|---|---|
| not installed | no plist | nothing |
| unsafe | the plist does not point at the copy, or the copy, `/Library/PrivilegedHelperTools` or `/Library` is a symlink, not owned by root, or writable by group/others; a plist on the legacy layout of early lx.11 builds (`/Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/com.leadaxe.sing-box-lxd/` or the flat file `/Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/com.leadaxe.sing-box-lxd`) is reported as “legacy layout — install, then remove it: `sudo rm -rf /Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/com.leadaxe.sing-box-lxd /Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/com.leadaxe.sing-box-lxd.install.json`” | red, with the command; a one-time dialog per launcher version; a WARN line in the log before every config apply |
| stale | the copy differs from the launcher core (sha256), or is missing | yellow, with the command |
| not running | the files are fine (plist on the safe copy, sha256 matches), but launchd does not run the service: not loaded or `state` ≠ `running` (`launchctl print`, no sudo) | yellow, with `sudo launchctl bootstrap system /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.leadaxe.sing-box-lxd.plist` — loading, not reinstalling |
| process stale | the files match, but the running daemon reports another binary (`executable_sha256` from `/admin/info`; with an older core — another version) | yellow, with the command |
| ok | the service runs the current root-owned copy | nothing |

An unsafe service is warned about loudly but not blocked: the VPN keeps working until
you run the command. `<launcher-core> lxd --service=status` (no sudo needed) prints
the same check from the core's side, comparing the copy with the binary that runs it:
exit 0 — ok, 2 — mismatch or unsafe, 3 — not installed, 4 — copy only (a copy without
the service, SPEC 137), 5 — not running (loaded state at launchd), 1 — error. The install
command may take up to ~20 s: the core waits up to 10 s for the old service to unload
and retries `bootstrap`. The copy lives outside the
launcher's data folder, so **Remove all data…** leaves the service in place and offers
its uninstall command through the copy.

### 2.2 The classic TUN start runs the same copy (SPEC 137)

In the classic engine on macOS a config with TUN starts the core as root through the
system password prompt (once per launcher session). Root runs only the root-owned
copy from §2.1 and system utilities by absolute path — never a file from the data
folder, the app bundle or `PATH`:

| Action | What root runs |
|---|---|
| Start with TUN | `/usr/bin/env -i PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin /bin/sh -c '<constant body>' start-singbox-privileged <data>/bin <copy> config.json /Library/Logs/sing-box-lxd 0 <your uid> 2097152` |
| Stop / restart | `/bin/kill -TERM <shell pid> <core pid>` |
| Kill in "Sing-Box already running" and in Diagnostics | `/usr/bin/pkill -TERM -f 'sing-box run\|start-singbox-privileged'` |
| Turning TUN off in the wizard | nothing — the launcher removes the leftovers itself |

The shell body is a constant compiled into the launcher, paths arrive as arguments,
and `env -i` keeps the launcher's environment (its `PATH`, exported bash functions)
away from the root shell. The `bin/start-singbox-privileged.sh` script of earlier
versions is no longer written and is removed on the next start.

Root never writes into your folders. The core's output goes to
`/Library/Logs/sing-box-lxd/classic.log` — a root-owned folder (`root:wheel 0755`)
with a file that belongs to you, `0600` (previous run in `classic.log.old`, same owner):
other local accounts cannot read it, and you cannot swap it for a link because the
folder is root's. The body checks your uid (digits, 501 or above, an existing
account), creates the folder, refuses to touch the folder or the file if either is a
symlink, of another type or another owner — the refusal reason reaches the startup
error — and rotates the file above 2 MiB. The
launcher only reads it: **Logs → Core** and the traffic profiler follow the log of the
last start (a non-TUN start keeps writing `<logs>/sing-box.log` itself). Turning TUN
off removes the root-owned cache and old core logs left in the data and log folders
with the launcher's own rights — the folder, not the file owner, grants deletion — so
no password is asked. **Remove all data…** does not remove
`/Library/Logs/sing-box-lxd` (it needs root): `sudo rm -rf /Library/Logs/sing-box-lxd`.

Before the password prompt the launcher checks the copy without sudo — the ownership
chain as in §2.1 and the sha256 of the copy against the launcher core. A missing,
unprotected or outdated copy (for example after a core update) stops the start, and a
dialog shows one command with **Copy the command**, **Run in Terminal** and **Retry**:

| Case | Command |
|---|---|
| no daemon service | `sudo <launcher-core> lxd --service=copy` — core lx.12+: only the copy and its `.install.json`, no plist, no launchd |
| the daemon service is installed | `sudo <launcher-core> lxd --service=install` — the §2 command; it refreshes the same copy and restarts the service |

After a core download the log gets a WARN with both sha256 values, and the next TUN
start shows the dialog. With a copy and no service, `<launcher-core> lxd --service=status`
exits with 4 (copy only).

---

## 3. Pairing (mTLS)

The channel to the daemon is mutually authenticated TLS. The client's credential is
its own certificate; pinning the server certificate is always mandatory.

An **invite** is a single line shaped like:

```
address#fingerprint#code
```

It is printed by the install command (the launcher extracts the invite from the
output of the privileged call and writes it to its own log with the invite redacted)
or by `lxd client add` — for re-pairing and for remote daemons. The invite is pasted
into the pairing field by hand.

**Who owns what.** The daemon's home is its own state directory: `daemon.json`,
holding the listen address and the admin secret, lives there and is served over
`GET /admin/info`. The launcher keeps only its own client keypair. Each machine gets
**its own** pair: a certificate is the entire credential, and one shared key across
all devices would mean that revoking access on one router revokes it everywhere.

> A practical consequence: **removing a machine from the list in the launcher does
> not revoke access.** Revocation happens on the machine itself — the launcher warns
> about this when you remove one.

---

## 4. Remote machines

A remote machine is a router, a VPS or another Mac running its core under
`sing-box lxd`, with the launcher acting as its mTLS client.

### 4.1 The Remote tab

`Local` and `Remote` are built the same way — servers on the left, management on
the right. The difference is only what is managed: your own core, or a list of
other machines. A machine's row shows its name, platform, address and core state;
the same row carries **Configure** (the wizard rooted on its profile), Start/Stop,
**Restart ↻** (Stop + Start as one action, behind a confirmation — the machine's
VPN clients blink during the restart), **Deploy**, edit, remove, and a **More**
block (traffic profiler, host telemetry, resources, diagnostics).

The machine's node list heals itself. Right after Start the daemon already
reports "started", but the core inside is still coming up and returns no groups
yet — so groups are polled in the background with retries, and the auto-refresh
tick re-reads them whenever the group selection is empty. An empty list right
after Stop/Start is a transient state measured in seconds, not a reason to
Disconnect/Connect.

The key property: **picking a machine and picking "who are we building for" are the
same choice.** "Configure" opens the wizard rooted on that machine's profile, and
Deploy in the same row ships that machine's own config. The "built for one, deployed
to another" mistake is impossible by construction, not caught by validation.

### 4.2 The registry entry

The machine registry is `bin/remote-daemons.json`. An entry (`services.RemoteDaemon`)
carries:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `id` | stable identifier (a slug of the name); also the directory name for the client keypair and the profile |
| `name` | human-readable name |
| `addr` | `host:port` of the control channel |
| `server_fingerprint` | SHA-256 pin of the server certificate; empty = plain h2c (a dev daemon on loopback) |
| `secret` | bearer secret; only needed by a plain-h2c daemon. Under mTLS the client certificate is the credential |
| `goos` / `goarch` | platform and architecture of the **machine** |

`goos`/`goarch` live here rather than in the wizard state because they are a
property of the machine, not of one of its settings. The row displays them, the
wizard reads them, generation builds a `TargetSpec` from them — one source of truth,
otherwise a way remains to build a config for an architecture other than the one
shown in the list.

### 4.3 One profile per machine — the on-disk layout

```
bin/
├── wizard_states/
│   ├── state.json                  — THIS machine's wizard state (historical layout)
│   ├── <name>.json                 — named local snapshots
│   └── remote/
│       └── <machine-id>/           — everything belonging to one machine
│           ├── state.json          — its wizard state
│           ├── config.json         — its built config
│           ├── srs/*.srs           — its rule-sets
│           └── subscriptions/*.raw — its subscription bodies
├── subscriptions/<id>.raw          — local subscription raw cache
└── rule-sets/*.srs                 — local SRS
```

Before SPEC 098 there was a single profile for all machines
(`wizard_states/remote/state.json` and `bin/remote-config.json`): configuring a
second machine silently overwrote the first. Existing installs migrate
automatically when **exactly one** machine is paired; with several, the old files
are left untouched and a warning is logged, because ownership cannot be determined.

### 4.4 Deploy

Deploy ships more than JSON. Before sending, the resources the config references are
collected — local rule-sets (`route.rule_set` entries of `type: local`) and
subscription bodies — and travel into the machine's resource store together with the
config (`services.CollectDeployResources`).

The config is adapted for the daemon before it is sent: relative paths the core
writes itself (`cache_file`) are made absolute against the daemon's directory (the
daemon starts with `cwd=/`), and `experimental.clash_api` is stripped — a machine's
config has no Clash API by design.

Delivery is the admin REST call `POST /admin/apply`: the daemon validates the config
**in a subprocess** before touching the running instance, and automatically rolls
back to the last working config if the new one fails to start. Start/Stop go through
`/admin`.

The whole "resources strictly before the config" chain is one function,
`services.RemoteRegistry.Deploy`: both the Deploy button and the Debug API
(SPEC 100) call it, so "deploying via the API works differently from the button"
is impossible by construction.

### 4.5 Observing a machine

| Tool | Source | What it shows |
|---|---|---|
| Proxy list | gRPC (`ProxyTransport`) | groups, node selection, latencies, balancer pool |
| Traffic profiler | gRPC streams (`SubscribeConnections`, `SubscribeDNSQueries`, `SubscribeStatus`) | connections and domains of the machine's **core**; a per-client breakdown instead of a per-process one |
| Host telemetry | admin REST | CPU, memory, storage, network of the **machine itself** |
| Resources | admin REST | the machine's resource store (rule-sets, subscription bodies) |

The profiler and the telemetry window are **one instance per machine**: two machines
must be openable side by side, which is exactly why one looks at these. Re-opening
focuses the existing window instead of starting a second stream; an instance dies
with its channel (on Disconnect and on machine removal).

gRPC subscriptions survive Deploy/Start/Stop. Recreating the core instance on the
machine tears down server-side streams — the transport treats that as a normal
event: it resets its state, waits a couple of seconds and resubscribes until the
subscription is cancelled (`runResilientStream`). The profiler and the status keep
showing live data without the Disconnect/Connect ritual.

A machine has no per-process breakdown and cannot have one: `find_process` is off in
a router's config because traffic comes from network devices, not from processes of
this computer.

---

## 5. Remote in the Debug API (SPEC 100)

The entire remote/daemon feature set is also available without the UI — through
the launcher's own Debug API (loopback + bearer). The full reference with
examples lives in [API.md](API.md); this section is about the principles.

- **Stateless addressing.** Every call names the machine explicitly —
  `/remote/machines/{id}/…`: registry and pairing, health, core
  Start/Stop/rollback, deploy, mirrors of the wizard state handles,
  observability, resources. The UI notion of the "active machine" (Connect on
  the Remote tab) does not affect working calls; the override itself is managed
  by the separate `/remote/ui*` handles and changes only what the Servers tab
  looks at.
- **Parity with the button.** Deploying via the API and via the Deploy button is
  the same `services.RemoteRegistry.Deploy` chain (§4.4).
- **Streams as snapshots.** `connections`, `dns/queries`, `logs` return a window
  (`?duration=…&max=…`), not an endless stream; SSE subscriptions are
  deliberately deferred.
- **Raw passthrough.** An arbitrary admin REST call (`…/raw/rest`) and an
  arbitrary gRPC call (`…/raw/grpc`, discovery via `GET /grpc/methods`) go
  **only** to the control channel of a paired machine, with its mTLS keys and
  pin from the registry. There are no requests to arbitrary addresses.
- **`/daemon/*` (darwin).** Status, pairing and engine of the local daemon, plus
  ready-made privileged command strings (`/daemon/commands`) — the API never
  executes them: "sudo only in your own terminal" applies here too.
- **The `capabilities` manifest.** `GET /` reports which groups this build has:
  Win7 — no remote at all, non-darwin — no `/daemon/*`.

---

## 6. Boundaries and requirements

- **Classic does not change.** The same spawn, the same Clash API, the same behavior.
- **Daemon is macOS-only for now.** Its engine code is shared by the daemon
  platforms (`darwin || (windows && !386)`, §1); on Windows it stays closed until
  the service layer of SPEC 141 and core v1.14.2-lx.2; Linux and Win7 compile
  stubs.
- **The core must support `lxd`** (`with_lx_command`). The pinned
  `constants.RequiredCoreVersion` includes that build (the current pin lives in `internal/constants/constants.go`).
  **A release name is not a trust boundary:** the launcher does not check the
  version string, the tag, or whether the core is a numbered `sing-box-lx`
  release before offering the service commands. Bring your own core
  (`1.15.0-jiejie-masquerade.5`, `custom-build`, `unknown`, an empty version) and
  Install / Update / Pair / Start all stay available. Whether a given binary
  really implements the `lxd` protocol is decided by *running* it: a core without
  the subcommand answers `unknown command "lxd"` and that real error is shown.
  To inspect the feature boundary by hand, run `sing-box lxd --help`.
- **Daemon installation uses the bundled launcher core.** The daemon page never
  downloads or substitutes an upstream release, and a version difference between
  the launcher core and the installed service copy is *status*, not an error: it
  is reported ("Service core differs from launcher core") together with the
  Install / Update command that aligns the copy with the launcher's core.
- **A remote config has no Clash API** by design — hence the gRPC sources for both
  the node list and the profiler.
